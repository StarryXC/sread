> It was the last day of final examinations in a large Eastern university. On the steps of one building, a group of engineering seniors huddled, discussing the exam due to begin in a few minutes. On their faces was confidence. This was their last exam before they went on to commencement and jobs.

> The Internet is one of those approaches. Learning via the Internet is a new style that many people believe is more successful than the conventional form of teaching. The Internet allows schools to develop a large amount of learning material that is accessible for students online anytime. There are so many choices of courses and subjects or time frames that completing a program is not an issue for students anymore. We found that online education gives us excellent sources of information, saves our time, money and it is extremely convenient.

> Not long ago we used to go to the library every time we needed information and spent hours searching for the right sources. Today there is a "library" in our house and it is available 24 hours a day. From my personal experience, as a first time mother, I found that using information online is very helpful. While I am at home with my baby, I am still able to connect to the world and search for any educational materials I need. I am also able to exchange thoughts, opinions and information with my classmates without leaving my house.

> The Internet is not only a big information provider but also saves us money and time. People are predicting that education will be much cheaper in the future because of Internet access to information. The cost of land, buildings and wages for teachers are continuously increasing and that makes conventional education more expensive than online education. In addition, regular courses (offline) depend heavily on books and other traditional paper-based materials while online education posts lectures, notes, and assignments electronically and that saves thousands of dollars every year. There is also no need for the classroom itself because most programs online require participation in discussion and group projects via e-mail.

> The Internet classes and courses are also very convenient because there are no physical restrictions as in conventional education like space and time limitations. First, in classroom-based education there is a limitation on the number of students that are allowed in each class while Internet education is available to everyone because a classroom is not an issue there. Students don't have to struggle in order to register for the classes they like. In addition, there is no time limitation so students can repeat exercises as many times as they need.

> Education will spread out more and more online and students will have more choices on how and when to take their courses and classes. They will easily be able to take the classes they want and repeat material on the Internet as many times as they need. The Internet is a wonderful opportunity to have a good time but also to learn something in a convenient and less expensive way. In my opinion online life in the future is simply inescapable.
